# Preview your deployments

Update your Docs (or website code) and get a preview link as a comment in your PR, so you can review the changes in a working website before merging your PRs. 

Alternatives I found were Vercel (20$ per user) and Netlify (19$ per user) - in their teams' pricing.

## Arch 
 
 1 - Make a PR with changes
 
 2 - Github actions builds and deploys the PR changes to https://fly.io
 
 3 - [Get a comment with a preview to your deployment](https://github.com/aabedraba/mkdocs-preview-deployment/pull/2#issuecomment-1089190308)
